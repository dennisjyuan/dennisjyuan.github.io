    title: Research interests
    summary: |
      My research interests are in utilizing multi-omics datasets to investigate remodeling of the immune system by cancer and treatments.
      My graduate  research is focused on biomaterial design to direct T cell functions, utilizing insights from the role of mechanics in T cell activation and the role of donor variability and disease progression on T cell dysfunction.
